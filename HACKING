style guide
-----------

Where possible when writing new code, try to stay as PEP8 compliant as possible.
We understand that large portions of the codebase are not, but part of our
ongoing efforts is to clean up whipper.

major data structures
---------------------

- image.table.Track: A list of track properties, including a list of indexes,
	the isrc, cdtext, pre-emphasis flag, track number, and track type (audio
	or data)

- image.table.Index: A list of track index properties, including the track's path,
	relative and absolute offsets within the track & disc, respectively, as
	well as the track number and counter.

- image.table.Table: An ordered list of Track objects, with their leadouts,
	cdtext, and catalog numbers.

- image.cue.CueFile: Generates an image.table.Table from a .cue file from an
	existing rip.

- image.toc.TocFile: Generates an image.table.Table from a .toc file generated
	by `cdrdao read-toc`.

notes
-----

test: single rip of kings of leon - only by the night

track  1: frame start      0, 17811 CD frames,
track  2: frame start  17811, 18481 CD frames
	  ARCue.pl says  2c15499a
track 11: frame start 166858, 25103 CD frames (14760564 audio frames)

191961 total CD frames

unicode
-------
- All text files should be read and written as unicode.
- All strings that came from the outside should be converted to unicode objects.
- Use asserts liberally to ensure this so we catch problems earlier.
- All gst.parse_launch() pipelines should be passed as utf-8; use
  encode('utf-8')
- morituri.extern.log.log is not unicode-safe; don't pass it unicode objects;
  for example, always use %r to log paths
- run with RIP_DEBUG=5 once in a while to catch unicode/logging errors.
- Also use unicode prefix/suffix in tempfile.* methods; to force unicode.
- filesystems on Unix do not have an encoding.  file names are bytes.
  However, most distros default to a utf-8 interpretation
- You can either treat paths as byte strings all the way without interpreting
  (even when writing them to other files), or assume utf-8 on in and out.
- also direct output to a file; redirection sets codec to ASCII and brings out
  unicode bugs

CDROMS
------

PLEXTOR CD-R   PX-W8432T Read offset of device is: 355.

test discs
----------
Julie Roberts - Julie Roberts: cdparanoia paranoid mode has a false positive
	jitter correction and silently rips the incorrect track. ripping with
	-Z rips the correct track.
Rush - Test for Echo: has 31 frames of silence in the first track's pregap,
	test for HTOA detection regressions.
The Strokes - Someday (promo): has 1 frame silence marked as SILENCE
The Pixies - Surfer Rosa/Come on Pilgrim: has pre-gap, and INDEX 02 on TRACK 11
Florence & The Machine - Lungs: data track
