FORK INFORMATION
---------
This branch is very close to morituri's master one (internal morituri references are still unchanged). As a starting point, I've just merged the following commits:
- [#79](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/79)
- [#92](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/92)
- [#109](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/109)
- [#133](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/133) (with custom `.travis.yml`)
- [#137](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/137)
- [#139](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/139)
- [#140](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/140)
- [#141](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri/issues/141)

And changed the default logger to [morituri-yamllogger](https://github.com/JoeLametta/morituri-yamllogger)'s one.

In order to track whipper's current development it's better to check its commit history (README *needs* to be updated).

**WARNING:** As whipper is still under heavy development sometimes I will force push (`--force-with-lease`) to the non master branches.

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
---------
* Whipper has adopted new config/cache/state file paths
  * Now always follows XDG specifications
    * Paths used when XDG environment variables are available:
      * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whipper`
      * `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/whipper`
      * `$XDG_DATA_HOME/whipper`
    * Paths used when XDG environment variables are **NOT** available:
      * `$HOME/.config/whipper`
      * `$HOME/.cache/whipper`
      * `$HOME/.local/share/whipper`
  * Configuration file information:
    * `.moriturirc`, `morituri.conf` aren't used anymore
    * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whipper/whipper.conf` (OR `$HOME/.config/whipper/whipper.conf`)
  * Plugins folder path:
    * `$XDG_DATA_HOME/whipper/plugins` (OR `$HOME/.local/share/whipper/plugins`)

WHIPPER [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoeLametta/whipper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JoeLametta/whipper)
---------
whipper is a fork of the morituri project (CDDA ripper for *nix systems aiming for accuracy over speed).

It improves morituri which development seems to have halted/slowed down merging old pull requests and improving it with bugfixes and new functions.

If possible, I'll try to upstream the progress done here but, in the future, this may not be possible because of different project choices.

RATIONALE
---------
For a more detailed rationale, see morituri's wiki page ['The Art of the Rip'](
http://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/wiki/DAD/Rip).

FEATURES
--------
* support for MusicBrainz for metadata lookup
* support for AccurateRip (V1) verification
* detects sample read offset and ability to defeat cache of drives
* performs test and copy rip
* detects and rips Hidden Track One Audio (only if not digitally silent)
* templates for file and directory naming
* support for lossless encoding and lossy encoding or re-encoding of images
* tagging using GStreamer, including embedding MusicBrainz id's
* retagging of images
* plugins for logging
* for now, only a command line client (rip) is shipped

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- cdparanoia, for the actual ripping
- cdrdao, for session, TOC, pregap, and ISRC extraction
- GStreamer and its python bindings, for encoding (it's going to be removed soonâ„¢)
  - gstreamer0.10-base-plugins >= 0.10.22 for appsink
  - gstreamer0.10-good-plugins for wav encoding (it depends on the Linux distro used)
- python musicbrainzngs, for metadata lookup
- python-setuptools, for plugin support
- python-cddb, for showing but not using disc info if not in MusicBrainz
- pycdio, for drive identification
  - Required for drive offset and caching behavior to be stored in the config file
- libsndfile, for reading wav files
- flac, for reading flac files
- sox, for track peak detection

GETTING WHIPPER
----------------
If you are building from a source tarball or checkout, you can choose to
use whipper installed or uninstalled.

- getting:
    - Change to a directory where you want to put the whipper source code
      (For example, `$HOME/dev/ext` or `$HOME/prefix/src`)
    - source: download tarball, unpack, and change to its directory
    - checkout:

            git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper.git
            cd whipper
            git submodule init
            git submodule update
            export PYTHON=$(which python2)

- building bundled dependencies

This is only needed if you do not have the 'accuraterip-checksum' package installed on
your system. whipper packages this for your convenience:

You can edit the install path in `config.mk`.

	cd src
	make
	sudo make install
	cd ..

- installation

	python2 setup.py install

RUNNING WHIPPER
----------------
whipper currently only has a command-line interface called 'rip'

rip is self-documenting.
`rip -h` gives you the basic instructions.

rip implements a tree of commands; for example, the top-level 'changelog'
command has a number of sub-commands.

Positioning of arguments is important;

    rip cd -d (device) rip

is correct, while

    rip cd rip -d (device)

is not, because the `-d` argument applies to the rip command.

Check the man page (rip(1)) for more information.


RUNNING UNINSTALLED
-------------------
To make it easier for developers, you can run whipper straight from the
source checkout:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    misc/morituri-uninstalled

GETTING STARTED
---------------
The simplest way to get started making accurate rips is:

- pick a relatively popular CD that has a good change of being in the
  AccurateRip database
- find the drive's offset by running

        rip offset find

- wait for it to complete; this might take a while
- optionally, confirm this offset with two more discs
- analyze the drive's caching behaviour

        rip drive analyze

- rip the disc by running one of

        rip cd rip  # uses the offset from configuration file
        rip cd rip --offset (the number you got before)  # manually specified offset

FILING BUGS
-----------
whipper's bugs are tracked using the repository issue section provided by GitHub.

morituri's bug tracker is at [http://thomas.apestaart.org/morituri/trac/](
http://thomas.apestaart.org/morituri/trac/).
When filing bugs, please run the failing command with the environment variable
`RIP_DEBUG` set; for example:

    RIP_DEBUG=5 rip offset find > morituri.log 2>&1
    gzip morituri.log

And attach the gzipped log file to your bug report.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
- no GUI yet
- only AccurateRip V1 CRCs are computed and checked against the online database
- `rip offset find` fails to delete the temporary .wav files it creates if an error occurs while ripping
- whipper only checks for the pre-emphasis flag in the TOC
  - To improve the accuracy of the detection, the sub-channel data should be scanned too
- cd-text isn't read from the CD (useful when the CD informations are not available in the MusicBrainz DB)

GOALS
-----
- quality over speed
- support one-command automatic ripping
- support offline ripping (doing metadata lookup and log rewriting later)
  - separate the info/result about the rip from the metadata/file generation/...

CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
The configuration file is stored according to [XDG Base Directory Specification](
http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
when possible.

It lives in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whipper/whipper.conf` (or `$HOME/.config/whipper/whipper.conf`)

The configuration file follows python's ConfigParser syntax.

The possible sections are:

- main section: [main]
  - `path_filter_fat`: whether to filter path components for FAT file systems
  - `path_filter_special`: whether to filter path components for special
                           characters

- drive section: [drive:IDENTIFIER], one for each configured drive
  All these values are probed by whipper and should not be edited by hand.
  - `defeats_cache`: whether this drive can defeat the audio cache
  - `read_offset`: the read offset of the drive

- rip command section: [rip.COMMAND.SUBCOMMAND]
  Can be used to change the command options default values.

Example section to configure "rip cd rip" defaults:

    [rip.cd.rip]
    unknown = True
    output_directory = ~/My Music
    track_template = new/%%A/%%y - %%d/%%t - %%n
    disc_template = %(track_template)s
    profile = flac

Note: to get a literal '%' character it must be doubled.
